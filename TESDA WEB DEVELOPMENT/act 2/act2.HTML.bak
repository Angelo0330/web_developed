	<h3 class="hh2">Country Located: China</h3> <br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction
		projects, the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km)
		long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km).</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>

	<p>
		The Great Wall of China is an ancient
	series of walls and fortifications, totaling
	more than 13,000 miles in length, located
	in northern China.

	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over
	the Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state
	of eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-
	soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost
	approximately $250,000 to build - much of the money was raised
	through donations.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		After its Polish rival, Christ the Redeemer is the largest Art Deco statue in
	the world. It was designed by Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski, before
	being constructed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa in
	collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. The face was the work of
	Romanian artist Gheorghe Leonida.

	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched
	between 2 towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a
	sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		Tucked away in the rocky countryside northwest of Cuzco, Peru, Machu Picchu is believed
	to have been a royal estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders, whose civilization was
	virtually wiped out by Spanish invaders in the 16th century.

	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid
	ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves,
	honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as
	the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		The name Chichen Itza is a Mayan language term for “at the mouth of the well of the Itza.”
	The Itza were an ethnic group of Mayans who had risen to power in the northern part of the
	Yucatan peninsula, where the city is located.

	<label>The Roman Colosseum</label><br><br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Continent Located: Europe</h3> 
	<h3 class="hh2">Country Located: Rome</h3> <br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum.
	Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The
	elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch
	the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle
	reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-
	robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the
	structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the
	construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		The Colosseum was built as part of an imperial effort to revitalize Rome after the
	tumultuous year of the four emperors, 69 CE. As with other amphitheatres, the emperor
	Vespasian intended the Colosseum to be an entertainment venue, hosting gladiator fights,
	animal hunts, and even mock naval battles.

	<label>Taj Mahal</label><br><br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Continent Located: Asia</h3> 
	<h3 class="hh2">Country Located: India</h3> <br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		A mausoleum commissioned for the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan,
	the Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1648. Considered the most
	perfect specimen of Muslim art in India, the white marble structure
	actually represents a number of architectural styles, including Persian,
	Islamic, Turkish and Indian.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		Indian, Persian and Islamic influences. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself,
	built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on
	the daylight. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains
	one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of
	India’s rich history.

	<label>Petra</label><br><br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Continent Located: Western Asia</h3> 
	<h3 class="hh2">Country Located: Jordan</h3> <br>
	<h3 class="hh2">Description of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the
	Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its prime from 9
	B.C. to A.D. 40. The members of this civilization proved to be early
	experts in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate tunnels
	and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-oasis.
	</p>
	<br><h3 class="hh2">History of the wonder:</h3>
	<p>
		The city of Petra was established as a trading post by the Nabateans, an Arab Bedouin tribe
	indigenous to the region in what is now southwestern Jordan. ... They continued to rule over
	the city for more than 250 years until the middle of the fourth century A.D., when an
	earthquake destroyed many of its buildings.
