					Pride is an excessive view of one's self without regard for others.
				</label>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					The Bible says the following in Jeremiah 9:23-24, “...Let not the mighty man boast of his might...but let him who boasts <br>

					boast of this, that he understands and knows Me...” <br>

					Pride is also mentioned in the following verses: Proverbs 8:13, Proverbs 16:18, Romans 12:16, 1 Corinthians 13:4, Galatians 6:3 and James 4:6-7. <br>
					Humility cures pride by removing one's ego and boastfulness, therefore allowing the attitude of service. <br>
