					Wrath is a strong anger and hate towards another person.
				</label>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					The Bible speaks about wrath in Romans 12:19, “Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, <br>

					for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.’” <br>

					Additional Bible verses include: Psalm 37:8, Proverbs 14:29, Proverbs 15:1, Ephesians 4:26-27, Colossians 3:8 and James <br>
					Patience cures wrath by one first understanding the needs and desires of others before acting or speaking. <br>
