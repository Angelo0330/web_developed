					Gluttony is an excessive and ongoing eating of food or drink.
				</label>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					1 Corinthians 10:31 says, “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, <br>

					or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” <br>

					Chastity or self-control cures lust by controlling passion and leveraging that energy for the good of others. <br>

					Additional Bible references include: Psalm 78:17-19, Philippians 3:19-20, Proverbs 23:1-3, Proverbs 23:19-21 and 1 Corinthians 3:16-17. <br>
					Temperance cures gluttony by implanting the desire to be healthy, therefore making one fit to serve others. <br>
