					Greed is an excessive pursuit of material goods.
				</label>
				<br><br><br>
				<p>
					The Bible says the following in Hebrews 13:5, “Let your conduct <br>

					be without covetousness; be content with such things as you <br>

					have. For He Himself has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’” <br>
					Other biblical texts which mention greed include: Exodus 20:17, Proverbs 11:24, Proverbs 28:25, Ecclesiastes 5:10, Philippians 4:6 and 1 Timothy 6:9-10. <br>
					Charity cures greed by putting the desire to help others above storing up treasure for one’s self. <br>
